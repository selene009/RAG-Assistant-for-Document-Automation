# RAG Document Automation Assistant
A domain-independent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built for long-document automation tasks.  
Originally developed for financial workflows, but the architecture is fully transferable to clinical documentation and guideline retrieval.

## Features
- BGE-based embedding wrapper (pseudo implementation)
- FAISS-like retrieval module
- Intent-based routing (RAG / structured lookup / math operations)
- Function-calling simulation for structured queries
- OCR + ASR multimodal components
- Architecture adaptable to clinical, financial, and compliance-heavy domains
